Cartoon intro for the â€” "Besprintsipnie" (Unprincipled). A phantasmagoric trip through intrigues, betrayals, embarrassing situations on different floors, and in the lanes of a prosperous Moscow district. Each scene is connected to a real place in a vicinity of Patriarch Ponds (Patriki) â€” London's Soho equivalent.

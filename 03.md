“Ostorozhno, Sobchak!" (Beware of Sobchak) is a YouTube show by Ksenia Sobchak (Russian TV journalist) in which she interviews celebrities. In early 2020 Lastik studio was commissioned to redesign the format of the show. The show already has a strong profile with 1.87 million subscribers and 272 million views. Title of the show is a play on words: “Sobchak” has reference to the word “dog” in Russian. Lastik wanted to develop an identity built on this irony and came up with a dog as a protagonist within the animated intro. The story is a surreal trip of dog-woman, Ksenia’s alter-ego, through her own subconsciousness.
